/*
Property 1: if there is only one thread that is ready to run, the
scheduler has to let it run.
Property 2: if a thread is ready to run, then the time it waits until
it runs is bounded.
Property 3: if there are threads waiting on a semaphore when a
thread executes signal, then one of the waiting threads has to be
woken. (instead of the same thread continuing to run)
Property 4: if a thread is waiting at a semaphore, then the number
of threads that will be woken before it is bounded. - Like a que implementation of waiting threads

/*
Explanation
Single thread case
When it gets to Line 8, it holds mutex and t1. Once it checks
room1, which is 0, it can release mutex and then open the second turnstile, t2.
As a result, it doesnâ€™t wait at Line 17 and it can safely decrement room2 and
enter the critical section, because any following threads have to be queued on
t1. Leaving the critical section, it finds room2 = 0 and releases t1, which brings
us back to the starting state.

Multiple thread case
In that case, it is possible that when the lead thread gets to Line 54, other threads
have entered the waiting room and queued on t1. Since room1 > 0, the lead
thread leaves t2 locked and instead signals t1 to allow a following thread to
enter Room 2. Since t2 is still locked, neither thread can enter Room 3.
Eventually (because there are a finite number of threads), a thread will get
to Line 54 before another thread enters Room 1, in which case it will open t2,
allowing any threads there to move into Room 3. The thread that opens t2
continues to hold t1, so if any of the lead threads loop around, they will block
at Line 46.

As each thread leaves Room 3, it signals t2, allowing another thread to leave
Room 2. When the last thread leaves Room 2, it leaves t2 locked and opens
t1, which brings us back to the starting state.
